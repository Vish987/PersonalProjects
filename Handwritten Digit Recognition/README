How to Run Program

To run this program, run the recognition.py file with the command line argument model.h5. This program is open-ended to allow many different 
models to train and test data, allowing an accurate representation of digits. Everything in the handwriting.py file can be changed to train 
the data with several models, such as adding new layers. To test the accuracy of a created model, run the handwriting.py file with the command 
line argument model.h5. Feel free to create new models and experiment with the digit recognition program.
